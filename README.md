# ZtransformApplet
This applet is a tool showing various representations of digital filters. 
You can enter up to 6 feed-forward and feedback coefficients which get represented in the following ways:
- Frequency (magnitude) response
- Phase response
- Difference equation
- Transfer function
- Pole-zero plot
- Block diagram
Coefficients can be smoothly changed by clicking and dragging the coefficient box. 
Finally, white noise can be fed through the filter to hear its effect in action.
